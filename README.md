## CHARTER VS DISTRICT TYPE SCHOOLS ANALYSIS 

Helping a school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

Analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. Student's math and reading scores were given, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Both data were aggregated and showcased obvious trends in school performance. 

Following are the guidelines for the findings in pandas analysis:

**District Summary**

* Created a high-level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**School Summary**

* Created an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per School Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**

* Created a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per School Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**

* Created a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include all of the same metrics as above.

**Math Scores by Grade**

* Created a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Reading Scores by Grade**

* Created a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Scores by School Spending**

* Created a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins for group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Scores by School Size**

* Repeated the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

**Scores by School Type**

* Repeated the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
